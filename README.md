# DST-validation-study-analysis
This repository contains the code for preprocessing and analysing data of the first online evaluation study of the "Digital Stress Test", published in JMIR 2022 ([https://doi.org/10.2196/32280](https://doi.org/10.2196/32280))

## Data
Data are stored on university servers. Outputs in the notebooks containing individual personal information are cleared. Only aggregated analyses are shown publicly.
## Run Code
To run the code, first create a conda environment including the packages mentioned in the dst_requirements.txt. 
To create a Conda environment from the `dst_requirements.txt` file, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the cloned git repository containing the `dst_requirements.txt` file.
2. Run the following command to create a new Conda environment:
```shell
conda create --name my_env --file dst_requirements.txt
```

Afterwards, you can run the jupyter notebook.
